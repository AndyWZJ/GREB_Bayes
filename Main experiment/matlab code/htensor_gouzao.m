% Construct htensor, now it is possible to construct it by yourself, just fill in the four parameters, children, dim2ind, U, B and you can construct it.
%If a 1024*512*26 (the third dimension is time) wants to simulate, and you want to add an extra line in the time dimension yourself, you can modify it on U{5}.
%Change the 26*r matrix of U{5} to 27*r and then reconstruct it to get the result as 1024*512*27, which the 27th is the matrix after the simulation.
% After simulation, all dimensional values remain unchanged except for the added dimensional values 미미미미
